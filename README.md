# QRT Data Challenge â€“ Stock Return Prediction

This repository contains our work for the **Qube Research & Technologies (QRT) Data Challenge**, carried out as part of our **Machine Learning course at ESILV, during the 2nd year of the engineering cycle**.

The goal of the challenge is to predict the **sign of residual stock returns** based on 20 days of historical data (returns and relative volumes), together with industry and sector information.  
The evaluation metric is the **classification accuracy** on the test set.
